    "gemini_response": "ANALYSIS:\nThe original email is polite and professional, aiming for clarity and understanding. To effectively transform it into a \"pirate\" tone, we need to replace the formal language with more colourful, nautical expressions, and adopt a more assertive, perhaps slightly threatening, persona. The directness of the message should remain, but the delivery will be much more theatrical.\n\nSUBJECT:\nAhoy, Matey! Where be our doubloons?\n\nREWRITTEN EMAIL:\nAhoy there,\n\nJust sendin' a cannonball across yer bow 'bout that invoice we sent some time ago, aye. We've not seen any o' yer hard-earned doubloons land in our coffers yet, so we're just checkin' if it's gone adrift or if there be any troubles brewin'.\n\nUnderstand if ye be sailin' through rough seas, but don't be keelhauled for forgettin' yer debts! Let us know if ye need us to send the map to the treasure (resend the invoice), or if ye have any questions 'bout the booty.\n\nThanks again, and we be waitin' to hear from ye afore we send the Kraken.\n\nFair winds (and timely payments!),\nThe Crew at AcmeHR",
